# Questions
- How to handle Bloodwood Saplings creation?
  - Altar recipe
  - Fluid Submerging
  - Killing Entities around another sapling
  - World Generation
  - Dungeon/Chest Loot

- Should Bloodwood trees have a unique shape?

- Should the Key of Binding be included? There are a few handlers that will need to be rewritten in order to handle the Key of Binding uses. It does have synergy with the Bloodwood doors.

- Should decorative blocks be included? If yes, which blocks should be excluded? (I think I would like to set these up to be included so they can be used in the dungeons if they are backported)

- How should Ritual of Forced Evolution be handled? Ritual sacrifices mobs to buff a single mob, increasing attribute values.
  - Bonuses applied
    - Randomly assign attributes
    - Use recipe system to assign attributes based on entity
  - Maximum Bonuses
    - Unlimited
    - Upgrade points (each bonus costs a flat amount)
    - Flat limit per attribute

- How the !@#$ do I get vanilla mixins to work?
