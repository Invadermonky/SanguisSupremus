* Ritual of Stolen Expertise was cut due to the amount of work it would entail. It was a neat idea with interesting mechanics, but ultimately such a small addition to Blood Magic was not worth the effort it would take to fully implement the ritual. It might be worth looking at another time as a standalone mod.
